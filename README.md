# Spotify OAuth 2.0 Streamlit Application

This repository is the home of my live Streamlit app, found at [this link](https://spotify-dashboard.streamlit.app/) (currently in beta and invite-only). 

The Streamlit app allows a Spotify user to log in via OAuth 2.0 and see a breakdown of their liked tracks - including their most-liked artists and short, medium, and long-term top tracks.

This app showcases some of the capabilities of the Spotify API and how its data could be extracted, presented, and analyzed.
